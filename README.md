# 🔢 NumberSense — Number Theory for Data Science

**NumberSense** is a data science–oriented project that bridges **classical number theory** with **modern data science applications**.  
The goal is simple: show how fundamental properties of numbers quietly power real-world data analysis, security, pattern detection, and feature engineering.

This project is designed to be both:
- 📘 **A learning platform** for students
- 📊 **An applied data science toolkit** for experimentation and analysis

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

While number theory is often taught as pure mathematics, it plays a critical role in:
- Feature engineering
- Hashing and data integrity
- Cryptography
- Randomness and simulations
- Fraud and anomaly detection

**NumberSense** makes these connections explicit and hands-on.
